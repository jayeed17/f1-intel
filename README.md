# F1 Intel

Race-by-race Formula 1 telemetry analytics and ML. Where drivers brake, where they lose time, how fast tyres fall off, what the optimal strategy was, and where each team can improve.

Built on [FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev) (official F1 timing feed, 2018+), FastAPI, scikit-learn, Plotly and Streamlit.

## Features

| Module | What it answers |
|---|---|
| Braking zones | Where does a driver brake, entry/min/exit speed, avg decel (g), per corner |
| Head to head | Speed/throttle traces, cumulative time delta, corner-by-corner brake point and min-speed diffs |
| Track dominance | Who is fastest in each minisector, drawn on the track map |
| Tyre degradation | Fuel-corrected deg rate (s/lap) per stint and per compound |
| Strategy simulator | Brute-force 1–3 stop plans vs what each driver actually ran, seconds lost vs optimal |
| Team report | Sector gaps, speed-trap deficit, race pace, pit lane time, auto "where to improve" notes |
| Tyre ML model | Gradient-boosted model predicting lap-time loss from tyre age, compound, fuel, temps, circuit, validated leave-circuit-out |

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --reload                 # API → http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py      # dashboard
pytest -q                                     # offline tests
python -m scripts.train_tyre_model --year 2025 --max-races 10   # train ML model
```

First load of any session downloads from F1's feed (30–90 s). After that it's served from `cache/`.

## API

| Method | Path | Example |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | |
| GET | `/schedule/{year}` | `/schedule/2025` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/drivers?session=R` | `/2025/Monza/drivers` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/braking/{driver}?session=R&lap=fastest` | `/2025/Monza/braking/LEC` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/compare?a=&b=&session=Q` | `/2025/Monza/compare?a=VER&b=NOR` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/dominance?drivers=&session=Q` | `/2025/Monza/dominance?drivers=VER,NOR,LEC` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/degradation` | `/2025/Monza/degradation` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/pits` | `/2025/Monza/pits` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/strategy?max_stops=2` | `/2025/Monza/strategy` |
| GET | `/{year}/{gp}/team-report?session=R` | `/2025/Monza/team-report` |
| POST | `/predict/tyre` | `[{"TyreLife":18,"LapNumber":30,"Compound":"MEDIUM","TrackTemp":42,"Circuit":"Italian Grand Prix"}]` |

`gp` accepts an event name (`Monza`, `Italian Grand Prix`) or round number (`16`). `session`: `R`, `Q`, `S`, `SQ`, `FP1`–`FP3`.

## Method notes and limits

- **Brake data is on/off, not pressure**, and car data is ~3.7 Hz. Brake points are accurate to roughly one sample (~20 m at speed).
- **Fuel correction** adds `0.035 s × (lap − 1)` (configurable in `app/config.py`), a public rule-of-thumb estimate.
- **Strategy model** assumes new tyres each stint and a linear deg curve per compound, fitted field-wide on green-flag laps relative to each driver's median (removes car pace). It ignores traffic, safety cars and tyre cliffs; treat totals as relative, not absolute.
- **Team report** compares public timing only. Real teams have far richer data; this finds visible symptoms, not root causes.

## Data

FastF1 pulls from F1's live timing service. This project is unofficial and not associated with Formula 1.

Race laps for degradation/pits/strategy/team-report are cached to `data/processed/{year}/{round}.parquet` on first request; later requests for that race skip FastF1 entirely. Telemetry-based routes (braking/compare/dominance) always load live.
